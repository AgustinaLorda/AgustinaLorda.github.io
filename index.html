    <h2>My Biography</h2>
    <p> My name is Agustina Lorda, and I am 21 years old. I am an international student from Uruguay, a country in South America. I have an older sister named Victoria, and my parents are Gustavo and Ines. I also have two dogs, a Saint Bernard and a Golden Retriever.</p>
    <p> Currently, I am a junior at Lincoln University, studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, and I maintain a 4.0 GPA. I came to the United States after being recruited for the women's soccer team, which was a huge opportunity for me as I have loved sports since I was young. Over the years, I've practiced gymnastics, ballet, tennis, handball, taekwondo, swimming, and now soccer.</p>
    <p> In terms of my academic and professional experience, I am proficient in Java and have hands-on experience with data science. Last summer, I completed an internship in data science, where I applied my skills to find solutions for environmental contamination. Additionally, I tutor math at Lincoln University, covering subjects from College Algebra to Calculus 2. I plan to graduate and pursue a masterâ€™s degree to further my studies in computer science and mathematics.
